BI SOLUTION: FOOTWEAR RETAIL ANALYSIS USING MICROSOFT POWER BI

A business intelligence (BI) solution that attempts to answer specific business questions using sales data from a footwear retail company and provide analysis that will give its executive management and store managers insights to help with decision-making and planning.

#### BI REQUIREMENTS / QUESTIONS: ####

The BI solution addresses the following questions:

- How are sales distributed across stores, locations, and over time?
- What have been the sales trends? Have there been any steep changes in the yearly trends? If so, what was/were the contributing factor(s)?
- How are Market Groups performing in terms of sales volume and gross profit over time? What are the top and bottom performing Market Groups in terms of profit and how have they contributed to overall profit growth?
- How are stores performing in sales? Which are the top-performing and underperforming stores and how are the average sales across these stores influenced by product categories?
- Who are the most valuable Customers? What have been their individual contributions to overall company sales over time?

#### KEY FINDINGS: ####

- The highest YOY sales growth ever recorded was in 2015, a record 478.7% sales increase from the year 2014 to 2015 (figure 1.0).
- YOY Sales growth has been on a steady decline since its peak value in 2015 (figure 1.0).
- 2015 saw the first and only year loss (-£3.3m), despite having the highest sales growth rate (478.7%). This is because the Cost of Goods (COGS) (£6.8 million) was significantly greater than the yearly sales (£3.5 million) for that year. (figure 1.2).
- The high COGS and huge loss in 2015 can be attributed to the Market Group “Girl Senior Shoes” which recorded an annual sale of about £42, 200, annual COGS of £5.3M, and a consequent loss of £5.2M. The contributing COGS from this market group accounts for more than 70% of the total COGS (£6.8M) for 2015 (Figure 1.4)
- 2021 recorded the least Sales Growth rate, a 41.4% decline from 2020. ( figure 1.0).
- Most of the 41.4% decrease in sales recorded in 2021 can be attributed to the 58.9% fall in sales via web transactions for the same year (Figure 1.5) and also the 87.5% fall in sales of Ladies Basic Boots between 2020 and 2021 (figure 1.6).
- Ladies Fashion Boots had been the best-performing Market group and maintained a constantly increasing  Sales growth from 2014 to the tail end of 2019. In early 2020, its sales suddenly began to experience a steady fall till the end of 2021.  At about the same time when it began to fall,  the Ladies Sport Casual and Ladies Fashion Sandals Market Groups began to experience a steady increase in sales till the end of 2021. At the end of 2021, both Market Groups were positioned at the 1st and 2nd positions respectively, in annual sales (Figure 2.5)
- Web Uk has been the best-performing store in terms of sales with a total of £17.2M in sales while Web Till records £744 pounds in sales as the worst performer (figure 2.0)
- 29 stores of the company’s 66 stores have been inactive since 2014. About 70% of these inactive stores are Concession Stores (Figure 2.3, 2.4)
- The “Intangibles” product category alone contributed to 50.47% of the Return on Sales (Figure 2.6).
- On average, for every £1M annual profit contributed by the Ladies Fashion Boots  Market Group, Intangibles contributes a negative annual profit (Loss) of -£1M thereby canceling the profits out (Figure 2.9).
- Over time, more sales have been recorded in the second half of the year than in the first (Figure 2.13).

#### CONCLUSION / RECOMMENDATIONS: ####

- The rapid and continuous decrease in sales that started at the end of 2019 can be reversed by implementing more online product-based marketing techniques.
- Since the start of the year 2020, market groups including “Ladies Sport Casual” and “Ladies Fashion Sandals” have consistently increased sales. To increase overall company sales, more items from these groupings might be distributed across all stores.
- A review and further investigation are warranted due to the consistently subpar sales performance of Intangible goods, which is of grave concern. Better marketing strategies for digital assets, service contracts, etc. can reflect actual profitability and cut down on overall losses.
